# inventory_managment_system_project using json and python

This repository is having all the codes with json files form making an inventory managment system during ETG AI/ML Internship

I've made an inventory managment system which is working on Nosql based database.I have used JSON file system for it

Following tasks can be performed on the system
1.New inventory can be added
2.chages can be made to existing inventory
3.purchase can be done 
4.record of all the trasactions are stored using the my_record.JSON file 

I have added five features per product as follows
1)Name
2)Price
3)Quantity
4)Weigth
5)Manufacture date

My Project can perform the following tasks
1.Generating Bills
2.Update inventory 
3.purchases certian product in inventory
4.Add items to inventory or update existing items
5.I have also included features such that it asks the user to reenter the quantity if the quantity of the product entered by the user is more than that of quantity available in the inventory
